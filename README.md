## Introduction

Rasengan.js is a powerful framework for building modern web applications with ease. This repository provides pre-prepared templates that you can use to kickstart your projects. Whether you are building a chatbot, an e-commerce site, a portfolio, or a dashboard, we have a template for you.

## Templates

We currently offer the following templates:

### Chatbot
- **Gemini**
  - **Description**: Gemini chatbot template, a ready-to-go chatbot app.
  - **Path**: `templates/chatbot/gemini`
  - **Language**: TypeScript

### Portfolio
- **Developer**
  - **Description**: Developer portfolio template to showcase your projects to potential employers.
  - **Path**: `templates/portfolio/developer`
  - **Language**: TypeScript

Additional templates are planned for various other categories, including e-commerce, dashboards, and more.
Certainly! Here's the revised "Usage" section of the README to accurately reflect the current process for using templates with the Rasengan.js framework:



## Usage

To utilize a template with Rasengan.js, follow these streamlined steps:

1. **Explore Templates**:
   - Visit [templates.rasengan.dev](https://templates.rasengan.dev) to browse through the available templates.
   - Identify the template you want to use and copy its `template-key`.

2. **Generate New Project**:
   - Use the Rasengan CLI to generate a new project based on your chosen template. This can be done without installing the CLI explicitly by using `npx`:

     ```bash
     npx create-rasengan@latest [project-name] --template <template-key>
     ```

   - If you do not specify the `[project-name]`, the CLI will prompt you to enter it during the process.

For example, to create a project using the Gemini chatbot template, you would execute:

```bash
npx create-rasengan@latest my-chatbot-app --template chatbot/gemini
```

This method ensures you are always using the latest version of the Rasengan.js CLI and the most updated templates available.
